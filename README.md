# Bass-O-Matic
A step sequencing music creation application. Live demo [here](https://bitwitch.github.io/bass-o-matic/).

## How it works
***headphones recommended**  

You can click on a rectangle to toggle it on or off. When you click play, the sequencer steps   
through each column and plays all of the notes in that column that are toggled on.

The top section of the sequencer (in orange) represents the lead synth. You can click the arrow    
in the orange tab to the right of the sequencer to select a different lead synth instrument.   
The lead synth is typically used to create the melody of a tune. 

The middle section (in purple) represents the bass synth. There is currently only one bass   
synth to choose. The bass synth is typically used to create a bassline for a tune.

The bottom section (in pink) represents the noise synth. You can click the arrow in the pink   
tab to the right of the sequencer to select either white or pink noise. The noise synth is  
typically used to emulate a hi-hat sound.
